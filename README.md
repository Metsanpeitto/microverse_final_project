# microverse_final_project


![Microverse](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microverse-blueviolet)


 This is the final project of the Microverse curriculum. It consists of a backend built with Ruby on Rails and a frontend built withReactjs/Redux. 

 The project itself offers a service, the renting of a boat for a period of time. 

 We did follow the given design of the website, but personalized the content, i.e., instead of booking an appointment to try a motorcycle, we built an app to book an trip in a ship. 

 
The user can manage ships and reservations. As well as explore the ones existing. 

Even if we are a team of two people, we decided to build the project based on the requirements of the group of 5 people.

 This project is composed by this repository and a frontend created with ReactJS. 
 
 [Get the ReactJS App here](https://github.com/Metsanpeitto/microverse_final_project_front)

 [Visit the front end here](https://dry-peak-20261.herokuapp.com/)

 In order to run it locally this rails app should be 
initialized before the ReactJS app.

- So Rails app will run on:

```cmd
 http://localhost:3000
```

- And the ReactJS app will run on:

```cmd
 http://localhost:3001
```
There is also a chance that the front end app is already obtaining the data from the deployed Rails API.
